                        I am a coding student aspiring to begin a career that will allow me to use the skills I am learning.  I have begun study in Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), and JavaScript.  I previously studied these subjects in the mid-2000's in order to open up promotional opportunities in my former career with the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR).  I was successful as applied what I learned in those classes.  Through the use of computing technology, I personally revolutionized many processes that aided both me and many others in our daily work.  This opened several promotional opportunities and I rose to the position of Classification and Parole Representative, a management role, prior to my retirement from CDCR in 2024. I was employed with CDCR from 1999 to 2024.  I am a United States Air Force veteran having served from 1993 to 1997 as a Fire Protection Specialist.

                        I have always loved working with computers and this is my first real attempt to work in this field.  I am a musician and play electric bass almost exclusively.  I have played in many bands over the years performing in hundreds of shows.  I was fortunate to play in a band that opened for country music singer John Michael Montgomery and later opened for singer Uncle Kracker.  We were also hired to play a barbecue catered by none other than Guy Fieri!  I am an avid genealogist and have spent years tracing my family's history.  I was married in 1995 to the love of my life and we have raised four children. We are excitedly expecting our first grandchild this summer!
