# Jason M. Ryan: Portfolio

## Description

I have put together a "bare bones" portfolio homepage.  The purpose of this portfolio is to provide potential employers with basic information about me, samplings of my work, and a means to contact me.  My motivation was two-fold: first, to provide this information to prospective employers and second, to practice my CSS skills.  Having studied CSS in the past in a limited format, I was able to grasp the concepts fairly quickly; however, the flexbox concept was absolutely new to me.  I spent a few hours honing these skills which, hopefully, is apparent in this version of the application.  It is noted that, at this point, I do not have any projects to showcase.  The five links provided are linked to a "Coming Soon" page that I added that alerts the user of the missing project and provides a link back to the home page.

## Usage

To view the webpage, navigate to [https://orian42.github.io/jryanprofile/](https://orian42.github.io/jryanprofile/).

This application can be viewed by anyone who has access to the link; however, my contact information is provided mainly for potential employers to contact me.  This information should not be used to add me to any marketing or social contact lists.

## Credits

There were no other collaborators to credit for the creation of this webpage.

The five background images in the "Work" section were downloaded from <a href="https://www.pexels.com/">pexels.com</a> which provides free stock photos and images.  The background image in the "Texture" section below my name was downloaded from <a href="https://www.freepik.com/">freepik.com</a> which also provides free images.

I "googled several" pages regarding CSS but spent a lot of time playing <a href="https://mastery.games/flexboxzombies/">Flexbox Zombies</a> to better learn the flexbox-related CSS language.
